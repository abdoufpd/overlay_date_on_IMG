# python #PIL 
Welcome to abdelkarim's mini projectðŸ™Œ
all of us had beatifull memories in photos but the problem is when we want to remember the photo's date ,It's very hard
#Any help or Question welcome to my instagram @FP.ABDOU

#this code 
the code is to overlay the date of an image on it ,not by exif data(because exif data changes every time we transfer an image)
the date is extracted by the generally img name (XXX-YYYYMMDD-XXX...) with os library

by changing the format of date to costum format (like YYYY-MM-DD) and overlay it in the position x=10 and y=imgHeight-fontSize-10(10 is the margin) by PIL library
and export it to /output folder
#notes : 
this code work with big number of photos all u need is to unsure that the photos is inside /IMGS folder
